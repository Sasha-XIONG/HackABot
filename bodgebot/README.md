# Bodgebot Challenge
## Background

Robot Fighting also more widely known as Robot Combat, is exactly what the name implies; robots custom built by individuals or teams battle each other in an arena. Robot combat is sorted into different weight classes from robots in the heavyweight class up to a whooping 110 kg to robots in the nanoweight class which have a maximum weight limit of only 25 g. A Bodgebot is a type of combat robot usually made from scraps and rubbish.
